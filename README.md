Automated Time Table Generator developed by me with the intention of providing a solution for lecture scheduling problems in engineering colleges.
Front end was designed using Angular framework and Spring Boot employed at the backend connected through REST APIs.
In a Test case, it has successfully scheduled 120 subjects and 60 practicals along with 74 teachers over 5 streams(COMPS, IT, Mech, ETRX, EXTC) with each stream having 4 academic years. Practicals were distributed batch wise in limited labs with Greedy approach used for scheduling.
